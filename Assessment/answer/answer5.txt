a local git repository is created basically to track changes in file, the following way shows how a local git repository will be created.

1) move into the file that is meant to be staged with "cd 'file-name' "
2) initialize git in the current folder with "git init"
3) git status shows the structure of the files that are yet to be added      to the staging area.

4) using "git add ."  or "git add 'name of file to be added'" adds the file to the staging area

5) "git commit -m 'message'" moves the file finally to the local repository where is can be fectch anytime when user wishes to get back the data using " git checkout 'name of file' "

	 Note: there are three areas while working with git
  i)the working area: this is the current area where the file you working   on is currently living.
  ii) the staging area: the file move to the staging area from the working area using git add
  iii)the local repository: the file is moved to te staging area to the local repository using the the git commit
